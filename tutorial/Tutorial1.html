this tutorial you will learn the basic features of WebGME. How to
create projects, how to instentiate objects, how to define your own
language and finally how to build a model according your language.
Along the way you will also learn how to use the different features of
our user-interface like the META&nbsp;and Composition modes.<br><h3>Main part of the user-interface</h3>Before
we begin it would be wise to define the different parts of the
user-interface so it would be easier to understand the tutorial later.
So let's see a snapshot with the main areas of the interface:<br><img style="width: 1000px; height: 905px;" alt="" title="Important areas of the WebGME user-interface" src="./img/ui_parts_base.png"><br>So now we know how the different parts of the UI is called so let's begin with the real modeling!<br><h3>Creating an empty project</h3>The
first step on the long path of modeling is to create an empty project.
To do this you simply have to open the project dialog which can be done
by pushing the <img style="width: 30px; height: 22px;" alt="" src="img/glyphicons_144_folder_open.png">
button on the main toolbar. On the dialog simply push the 'Create
empty...' button which gives you a textbox where you can type the
desired name of your project (SignalFlow for example), then you can
start the actual project creation by pressing the 'Create' button. In
your new project you already have a so called basic seed, which is
really the first building blocks which are essential for a project. You
get a 'ROOT' object which will be the root of your conainment hierarchy
and you will put all of your object under it. You also get an 'FCO'
object (stands for First Class Object) which is the root of the
inheritance hierarchy, which means that it will be the base of all your
objects.<br><br><h3>Creating the 'Language' folder</h3>As in WebGME
there is no distinction between your META objects and the actual model
objects you probably would like to separate the building blocks of your
language from the actual models you build with them. To be able to do
this you need a 'place' (a well defined object) where you will be able
to create the elements of your language. In the mode selector choose
the Composition and on the Object Browser select the Root object (the
single FCO object become visible on the main panel). Drag the FCO
object from the Parts panel onto the main panel. Now you've just
created an instance of your FCO! Select it and rename in the property
editor to 'Language'. Now we have our object, but it doesn't have any
rules which means it cannot contain any other object (as that is the
default behaviour). To add a containment rule to our new object we have
to first switch to the META mode (just click on the META label on the
mode selection panel). In this mode the FCO is visible, but you can see
that it is rendered differently (more like an UML class on a UML class
diagram). This mode allows the manipulation of your language rules. To
allow the Language object to have rules first you have to drag it onto
the main panel from the object browser. After dragging the inheritance
relation between Language and FCO becomes visible immediately. To be
able to use the Language as a folder we will allow it to have any kind
of children. To do this we will allow it to have FCO type children.
Select the -diamond headed line - on the line bar and draw a line from
the FCO to the Language object (your valid connection points become
visible once your mouse is over an object, and when you start drawing
your line all the possible endings of the line becomes visible). If we
are done, we can start creating our own language objects. The current
META mode shows the following picture:<br><img style="width: 1000px; height: 906px;" alt="" src="img/meta_language.png"></body></html>
